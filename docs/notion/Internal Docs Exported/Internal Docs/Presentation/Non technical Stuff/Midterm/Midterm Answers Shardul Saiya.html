The Midterm will be composed exclusively of a time appropriate set of these questions reduced or with some variations.You may work together to answer these questions together and prepare for the test. Your team must return your final team agreed upon answers back to your TA/tutor mentor contact by Monday May 6th at noon for any adjustments. Those adjustments may be discussed in discussion in case modifications for study need to be made for the midterm.</blockquote><ol id="f3c72aff-21fb-46e1-a969-2bbfdf720f2b" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Definitions<ol id="e17ebb1c-b562-451c-8627-f17d79aa3577" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>In your own words try to precisely define Software Engineering. (Hint: Focus on the second word)</li></ol></li></ol><blockquote id="1d27ceeb-1bc7-4c79-b6c0-6f62eeb014f4">Software engineering is the production of software through a series of well-defined processes with an emphasis on reliability, security, maintainability, and repeatability. Software engineering is not a “miraculous event”, but the result of a strict adherence to processes.Software engineering is an application of a widely researched and accepted methodology in designing, developing and maintaining software in order to reach the highest possible effectiveness.Just like engineering processes, we need to make our software development more repeatable and ‘engineering-like’ even though we may think of it as ‘artistry’. We have to focus on security and dependability just as much as an engineer building a bridge, who is unable to go back and do bug fixes or version updates.</blockquote><ol id="de3c8345-ef27-4b75-a6c9-1dba538d4e32" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Define what you think Code Craftsmanship involves</li></ol><blockquote id="5604bfcd-473a-4252-9c5b-eb3327e02328">Code craftsmanship describes the artistic processes behind software engineering; craftsmanship involves creativity, ingenuity, and out-of-the-box thinking. It is the more emotional element behind software.</blockquote><ol id="b51aff3d-0efd-4da8-bf9c-f509e58d2b26" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Define what you think Software Manufacturing involves?</li></ol><blockquote id="87c27a8e-9fda-43c4-b83f-531f24eca7a6">Software manufacturing is the process of producing software in ways similar to the manufacturing of tangible goods. It is methodical, repeatable, and largely automated. It describes the more logical, less people-involved element behind software. Hence an important part of this process is the conveyor belt which allows code to go through the same processes to produce predictable results.</blockquote><ol id="0f4e9aeb-8a0e-45a5-a6fb-1f2593f2c6a6" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>Does Software Engineering contain these ideas or is it separate and different? Explain your opinion</li></ol><blockquote id="f42ceb3d-3c24-48c1-ad8c-fd6f156db70a">Software engineering contains these ideas; without the craftsmanship, there is no ingenuity in designing software solutions to problems; we need the human element to come up with solutions in the first place. However, without the manufacturing part, our process of building these solutions devolves into chaos. Software that works becomes a “miracle event”, and there is no repeatable and rational way to build software solutions.</blockquote><ol id="e8384fbe-7211-49d2-9f8c-c471e4bfb51d" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>The Atlantic article we read for the first homework suggested that our industry is a bit loose in its use of the word Engineer, why did the article’s author feel that is the case?</li></ol><blockquote id="3a890ba1-bc81-4a60-a115-9f7fc9f51c8c">This is because the word engineer carries a much heavier meaning when it comes to traditional description of the engineering job. Engineer is an aspirational title that is expected to be certified, regulated, and subject to apprenticeship and continuing education. They should claim and explicit responsibility to public safety, even if it doesn’t always deliver. However, this is not always the case as there is a lot of data breaches caused by software failures. Moreover, the word engineer traditionally related to licensure, certification, and ABET-approved 4 year degree, but that is not the case of Information-technology industry since they don’t value certification as much as other engineer sector does. Additionally, software engineer has moved on from creating a long-term plan and intricate documentation to a short term, but adaptable, agile development method which contradicts to the traditional meaning of dependable and long live product of engineering.</blockquote><ol id="5c76e93c-f0fc-4783-abb3-74dce30bcf68" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>If a super tool/language/framework existed that could make our developer productivity significantly better what downsides might we encounter if we adopted that super thing?</li></ol><blockquote id="34957878-aab4-4aac-a171-0be5589fa907">Possible downsides we might encounter if we adopt the super tool/language/framework:</blockquote><ul id="6971434f-4b87-4afb-8ce5-2301eb4b6af4" class="bulleted-list"><li>learning curve that will waste development time</li></ul><ul id="bcbe7b38-4ccd-4475-a877-5e5accbdb33a" class="bulleted-list"><li>Might become obsolete when the next super tool comes out</li></ul><ul id="10e3765a-7639-4f08-96a3-9dd4bf9d70c5" class="bulleted-list"><li>Too much abstractions, don’t understand what’s happening under the hood</li></ul><ul id="1ce4861d-f39f-46d4-9015-abf4a7f9b17d" class="bulleted-list"><li>Might run into problems when it’s no longer supported</li></ul><ul id="d770e8bb-afc3-4374-9f68-53d398c31fe1" class="bulleted-list"><li>User performance/ experience may be worse</li></ul><ol id="5712f730-c214-41eb-ac58-fa46b0310fe2" class="numbered-list" start="1"><li>It is commonly held that in fact people are the key to productivity more than tools.

As a group come up with 5 questions you want to make sure that each of the members of your team can answer about software engineering, your team, hard lessons, etc. that you think will serve you as software engineers. These questions will absolutely be on your team’s midterm. However, to avoid you from just putting questions like “Is 3 an odd number?” we must see the questions and approve them. Turn in your questions by Saturday May 4th at Noon for vetting to your group mentor (TA/tutor). This part of the test will be graded separately from the main part and will be normalized to avoid group gaming of the grade. It is roughly worth 15% of the overall grade of the midterm.</blockquote><p id="f82ce58d-bb10-4af9-b9f1-ce98e85d2c40">(SUBMITTED)</p></div></article></body></html>
